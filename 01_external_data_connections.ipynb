         "The data on the number of species of insects associated with various trees in Britain have been reanalyzed to factor out possible bias from phylogenetic effects. It was found that tree availability (range and abundance) continues to provide a good predictor (r = 0. 852) of insect-species richness, slightly better than straightforward cross-species analyses. Of the two components of tree availability, tree abundance gives a much better prediction than tree range. The species richness on trees of major taxa with similar trophic habits (Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera/Symphyta and the two suborders of the Homoptera-Auchenorrhyncha and Sternorrhyncha) shows positive correlations; there is thus no evidence of competitive exclusion at this taxonomic level.",

         "A modification of the Paul-Straubel trap previously described by us may profitably be operated in a Paul-Straubel-Kingdon (PSK) mode during the initial loading of an individual ion into the trap. Thereby the coating of the trap ring electrode by the atomic beam directed upon it in earlier experiments is eliminated, as is the ionization of an already trapped ion. Coating created serious problems as it spot-wise changed the work function of the ring electrode, which caused large, uncontrolled dc fields in the trap center that prevented zero-point confinement. Operating the Paul-Straubel trap with a small negative bias on the ring electrode wire is all that is required to realize the PSK mode. In this mode the tiny ring trap in the center of the long, straight wire section is surrounded by a second trapping well shaped like a long, thin-walled cylindrical shell and extending to the end-caps. There, ions may be conveniently created in this well without danger of coating the ring with barium. In addition, the long second well is useful as a multi-ion reservoir.",

         "This paper deals with a luminous electric discharge that forms in the mesospheric region between thundercloud tops and the ionosphere at 90-km altitude. These cloud-ionosphere discharges (CIs), following visual reports dating back to the 19th century, were finally imaged by a low-light TV camera as part of the \"SKYFLASH\" program at the University of Minnesota in 1989. Many observations were made by various groups in the period 1993-1996. The characteristics of CIs are that they have a wide range of sizes from a few kilometers up to 50 km horizontally; they extend from 40 km to nearly 90 km vertically, with an intense region near 60-70 km and streamers extending down toward cloud tops; the CIs are partly or entirely composed of vertical luminous filaments of kilometer size. The predominate color is red. The TV images show that the CIs usually have a duration less than one TV field (16.7 ms), but higher-speed photometric measurements show that they last about 3 ms, and are delayed 3 ms after an initiating cloud-ground lightning stroke; 95% of these initiating strokes are found to be \"positive\"-i.e., carry positive charges from clouds to ground. The preference for positive initiating strokes is not understood. Theories of the formation of CIs are briefly reviewed.",

This value is inconsistent with theoretical predictions based on diffusive classical scaling models, but it can be understood by a quantum-directed percolative filamentary amplitude model in which electronic basis states exist which have a well-defined momentum parallel but not normal to the applied electric field. The model, which is based on a new kind of broken symmetry, also explains the anomalous sign reversal of the derivative of the temperature dependence in the critical regime.",

         "The threshold behavior of the transport properties of a random metal in the critical region near a metal-insulator transition is strongly affected by the measuring electromagnetic fields. In spite of the randomness, the electrical conductivity exhibits striking phase-coherent effects due to broken symmetry, which greatly sharpen the transition compared with the predictions of effective medium theories, as previously explained for electrical conductivities. Here broken symmetry explains the sign reversal of the T --> 0 magnetoconductance of the metal-insulator transition in Si(B,P), also previously not understood by effective medium theories. Finally, the symmetry-breaking features of quantum percolation theory explain the unexpectedly very small electrical conductivity temperature exponent alpha = 0.22(2) recently observed in Ni(S,Se)2 alloys at the antiferromagnetic metal-insulator transition below T = 0.8 K.",

         "Predators of herbivorous animals can affect plant populations by altering herbivore density, behavior, or both. To test whether the indirect effect of predators on plants arises from density or behavioral responses in a herbivore population, we experimentally examined the dynamics of terrestrial food chains comprised of old field plants, leaf-chewing grasshoppers, and spider predators in Northeast Connecticut. To separate the effects of predators on herbivore density from the effects on herbivore behavior, we created two classes of spiders: (i) risk spiders that had their feeding mouth parts glued to render them incapable of killing prey and (ii) predator spiders that remained unmanipulated. We found that the effect of predators on plants resulted from predator-induced changes in herbivore behavior (shifts in activity time and diet selection) rather than from predator-induced changes in grasshopper density. Neither predator nor risk spiders had a significant effect on grasshopper density relative to a control. This demonstrates that the behavioral response of prey to predators can have a strong impact on the dynamics of terrestrial food chains. The results make a compelling case to examine behavioral as well as density effects in theoretical and empirical research on food chain dynamics.",

         "In 1979, Lewontin and I borrowed the architectural term \"spandrel\" (using the pendentives of San Marco in Venice as an example) to designate the class of forms and spaces that arise as necessary byproducts of another decision in design, and not as adaptations for direct utility in themselves. This proposal has generated a large literature featuring two critiques: (i) the terminological claim that the spandrels of San Marco are not true spandrels at all and (ii) the conceptual claim that they are adaptations and not byproducts. The features of the San Marco pendentives that we explicitly defined as spandrel-properties-their necessary number (four) and shape (roughly triangular)-are inevitable architectural byproducts, whatever the structural attributes of the pendentives themselves. The term spandrel may be extended from its particular architectural use for two-dimensional byproducts to the generality of \"spaces left over,\" a definition that properly includes the San Marco pendentives. Evolutionary biology needs such an explicit term for features arising as byproducts, rather than adaptations, whatever their subsequent exaptive utility. The concept of biological spandrels-including the examples here given of masculinized genitalia in female hyenas, exaptive use of an umbilicus as a brooding chamber by snails, the shoulder hump of the giant Irish deer, and several key features of human mentality-anchors the critique of overreliance upon adaptive scenarios in evolutionary explanation. Causes of historical origin must always be separated from current utilities; their conflation has seriously hampered the evolutionary analysis of form in the history of life.",

         "Contrary to previous theoretical studies at the UHF/6-31G* level, the methonium radical dication CH5(2+) is not a Cs symmetrical structure with a 2e-3c bond but a C2v symmetrical structure 1 with two 2e-3c bonds (at the UHF/6-31G**, UMP2/6-31G**, and UQCISD(T)/6-311G** levels). The Cs symmetrical structure is not even a minimum at the higher level of calculations. The four hydrogen atoms in 1 are bonded to the carbon atom by two 2e-3c bonds and the fifth hydrogen atom by a 2e-2c bond. The unpaired electron of 1 is located in a formal p-orbital (of the sp2-hybridized carbon atom) perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. Hydrogen scrambling in 1 is however extremely facile, as is in other C1 cations. It is found that the protonation of methane to CH5(+) decreases the energy for subsequent homolytic cleavage resulting in the exothermic (24.1 kcal/mol) formation of CH4(+*). Subsequent reaction with neutral methane while reforming CH5(+) gives the methyl radical enabling reaction with excess methane to ethane and H2. The overall reaction is endothermic by 11.4 kcal/mol, but offers under conditions of oxidative removal of H2 an alternative to the more energetic carbocationic conversion of methane.",

         "A key step in the conversion of solar energy into chemical energy by photosynthetic reaction centers (RCs) occurs at the level of the two quinones, Q(A) and Q(B), where electron transfer couples to proton transfer. A great deal of our understanding of the mechanisms of these coupled reactions relies on the seminal work of Okamura et al. [Okamura, M. Y., Isaacson, R. A., & Feher, G. (1975) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88, 3491-3495], who were able to extract with detergents the firmly bound ubiquinone Q(A) from the RC of Rhodobacter sphaeroides and reconstitute the site with extraneous quinones. Up to now a comparable protocol was lacking for the RC of Rhodopseudomonas viridis despite the fact that its Q(A) site, which contains 2-methyl-3-nonaprenyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (menaquinone-9), has provided the best x-ray structure available. Fourier transform infrared difference spectroscopy, together with the use of isotopically labeled quinones, can probe the interaction of Q(A) with the RC protein. We establish that a simple incubation procedure of isolated RCs of Rp. viridis with an excess of extraneous quinone allows the menaquinone-9 in the Q(A) site to be almost quantitatively replaced either by vitamin K(1), a close analogue of menaquinone-9, or by ubiquinone. To our knowledge, this is the first report of quinone exchange in bacterial photosynthesis. The Fourier transform infrared data on the quinone and semiquinone vibrations show a close similarity in the bonding interactions of vitamin K(1) with the protein at the Q(A) site of Rp. viridis and Rb. sphaeroides, whereas for ubiquinone these interactions are significantly different. The results are interpreted in terms of slightly inequivalent quinone-protein interactions by comparison with the crystallographic data available for the Q(A) site of the two RCs.",

         "Whether phytophagous insects can speciate in sympatry when they shift and adapt to new host plants is a controversial question. One essential requirement for sympatric speciation is that disruptive selection outweighs gene flow between insect populations using different host plants. Empirical support for host-related selection (i.e., fitness trade-offs) is scant, however. Here, we test for host-dependent selection acting on apple (Malus pumila)- and hawthorn (Crataegus spp.)-infesting races of Rhagoletis pomonella (Diptera: Tephritidae). In particular, we examine whether the earlier fruiting phenology of apple trees favors pupae in deeper states of diapause (or with slower metabolisms/development rates) in the apple fly race. By experimentally lengthening the time period preceding winter, we exposed hawthorn race pupae to environmental conditions typically faced by apple flies. This exposure induced a significant genetic response at six allozyme loci in surviving hawthorn fly adults toward allele frequencies found in the apple race. The sensitivity of hawthorn fly pupae to extended periods of warm weather therefore selects against hawthorn flies that infest apples and helps to maintain the genetic integrity of the apple race by counteracting gene flow from sympatric hawthorn populations. Our findings confirm that postzygotic reproductive isolation can evolve as a pleiotropic consequence of host-associated adaptation, a central tenet of nonallopatric speciation. They also suggest that one reason for the paucity of reported fitness trade-offs is a failure to consider adequately costs associated with coordinating an insect's life cycle with the phenology of its host plant.",

Likelihood ratio testing is used here for the first time to evaluate specific hypotheses that account for the induction of shifts in rates of DNA evolution. A molecular phylogenetic investigation of mutualist (lichen-forming fungi and fungi associated with liverworts) and nonmutualist fungi revealed four independent transitions to mutualism. We demonstrate a highly significant association between mutualism and increased rates of nucleotide substitutions in nuclear ribosomal DNA, and we demonstrate that a transition to mutualism preceded the rate acceleration of nuclear ribosomal DNA in these lineages. Our results suggest that the increased rate of evolution after the adoption of a mutualist lifestyle is generalized across the genome of these mutualist fungi.",

         "Recent paleontological discoveries in Madagascar document the existence of a diverse clade of palaeopropithecids or \"sloth lemurs\": Mesopropithecus (three species), Babakotia (one species), Palaeopropithecus (three species), and Archaeoindris (one species). This mini-radiation of now extinct (\"subfossil\") lemurs is most closely related to the living indrids (Indri, Propithecus, and Avahi). Whereas the extant indrids are known for their leaping acrobatics, the palaeopropithecids (except perhaps for the poorly known giant Archaeoindris) exhibit numerous skeletal design features for antipronograde or suspensory positional behaviors (e.g., high intermembral indices and mobile joints). Here we analyze the curvature of the proximal phalanges of the hands and feet. Computed as the included angle (theta), phalangeal curvature develops in response to mechanical use and is known to be correlated in primates with hand and foot function in different habitats; terrestrial species have straighter phalanges than their arboreal counterparts, and highly suspensory forms such as the orangutan possess the most curved phalanges. Sloth lemurs as a group are characterized by very curved proximal phalanges, exceeding those seen in spider monkeys and siamangs, and approaching that of orangutans. Indrids have curvatures roughly half that of sloth lemurs, and the more terrestrial, subfossil Archaeolemur possesses the least curved phalanges of all the indroids. Taken together with many other derived aspects of their postcranial anatomy, phalangeal curvature indicates that the sloth lemurs are one of the most suspensory clades of mammals ever to evolve.",

         "Diploid (2n = 2x = 24) Solanum species with endosperm balance number (EBN) = 1 are sexually isolated from diploid 2EBN species and both tetraploid (2n = 4x = 48, 4EBN) and haploid (2n = 2x = 24, 2EBN) S. tuberosum Group Tuberosum. To sexually overcome these crossing barriers in the diploid species S. commersonii (1EBN), the manipulation of the EBN was accomplished by scaling up and down ploidy levels. Triploid F1 hybrids between an in vitro-doubled clone of S. commersonii (2n = 4x = 48, 2EBN) and diploid 2EBN clones were successfully used in 3x x 4x crosses with S. tuberosum Group Tuberosum, resulting in pentaploid/near pentaploid BC1 progenies. This provided evidence of 2n (3x) egg formation in the triploid female parents. Two selected BC1 pentaploid hybrids were successfully backcrossed both as male and as female parents with S. tuberosum Group Tuberosum. The somatic chromosome number varied greatly among the resulting BC2 progenies, which included hyperaneuploids, but also a number (4.8%) of 48-chromosome plants. The introgression of S. commersonii genomes was confirmed by the presence of S. commersonii-specific randomly amplified polymorphic DNA markers in the BC2 population analyzed. The results clearly demonstrate the feasibility of germplasm introgression from sexually isolated diploid 1EBN species into the 4x (4EBN) gene pool of the cultivated potato using sexual hybridization. Based on the amount and type of genetic variation generated, cumbersomeness, general applicability, costs, and other factors, it would be interesting to compare the approach reported here with other in vitro or in vivo, direct or indirect, approaches previously reported.",

         "The crystal structure of raite was solved and refined from data collected at Beamline Insertion Device 13 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, using a 3 x 3 x 65 microm single crystal. The refined lattice constants of the monoclinic unit cell are a = 15.1(1) A; b = 17.6(1) A; c = 5.290(4) A; beta = 100.5(2) degrees; space group C2/m. The structure, including all reflections, refined to a final R = 0.07. Raite occurs in hyperalkaline rocks from the Kola peninsula, Russia. The structure consists of alternating layers of a hexagonal chicken-wire pattern of 6-membered SiO4 rings. Tetrahedral apices of a chain of Si six-rings, parallel to the c-axis, alternate in pointing up and down. Two six-ring Si layers are connected by edge-sharing octahedral bands of Na+ and Mn3+ also parallel to c. The band consists of the alternation of finite Mn-Mn and Na-Mn-Na chains. As a consequence of the misfit between octahedral and tetrahedral elements, regions of the Si-O layers are arched and form one-dimensional channels bounded by 12 Si tetrahedra and 2 Na octahedra. The channels along the short c-axis in raite are filled by isolated Na(OH,H2O)6 octahedra. The distorted octahedrally coordinated Ti4+ also resides in the channel and provides the weak linkage of these isolated Na octahedra and the mixed octahedral tetrahedral framework. Raite is structurally related to intersilite, palygorskite, sepiolite, and amphibole.",

         "The monolayer tapetum cells of the maturing flowers of Brassica napus contain abundant subcellular globuli-filled plastids and special lipid particles, both enriched with lipids that are supposed to be discharged and deposited onto the surface of adjacent maturing pollen. We separated the two organelles by flotation density gradient centrifugation and identified them by electron microscopy. The globuli-filled plastids had a morphology similar to those described in other plant species and tissues. They had an equilibrium density of 1.02 g/cm(3) and contained neutral esters and unique polypeptides. The lipid particles contained patches of osmiophilic materials situated among densely packed vesicles and did not have an enclosing membrane. They exhibited osmotic properties, presumably exerted by the individual vesicles. They had an equilibrium density of 1.05 g/cm(3) and possessed triacylglycerols and unique polypeptides. Several of these polypeptides were identified, by their N-terminal sequences or antibody cross-reactivity, as oleosins, proteins known to be associated with seed storage oil bodies. The morphological and biochemical characteristics of the lipid particles indicate that they are novel organelles in eukaryotes that have not been previously isolated and studied. After lysis of the tapetum cells at a late stage of floral development, only the major plastid neutral ester was recovered, whereas the other abundant lipids and proteins of the two tapetum organelles were present in fragmented forms or absent on the pollen surface.",

         "The classical problem of thermal explosion is modified so that the chemically active gas is not at rest but is flowing in a long cylindrical pipe. Up to a certain section the heat-conducting walls of the pipe are held at low temperature so that the reaction rate is small and there is no heat release; at that section the ambient temperature is increased and an exothermic reaction begins. The question is whether a slow reaction regime will be established or a thermal explosion will occur. The mathematical formulation of the problem is presented. It is shown that when the pipe radius is larger than a critical value, the solution of the new problem exists only up to a certain distance along the axis. The critical radius is determined by conditions in a problem with a uniform axial temperature. The loss of existence is interpreted as a thermal explosion; the critical distance is the safe reactor's length. Both laminar and developed turbulent flow regimes are considered. In a computational experiment the loss of the existence appears as a divergence of a numerical procedure; numerical calculations reveal asymptotic scaling laws with simple powers for the critical distance.",

         "Phospholipid signaling mediated by lipid-derived second messengers or biologically active lipids is still new and is not well established in plants. We recently have found that lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE), a naturally occurring lipid, retards senescence of leaves, flowers, and postharvest fruits. Phospholipase D (PLD) has been suggested as a key enzyme in mediating the degradation of membrane phospholipids during the early stages of plant senescence. Here we report that LPE inhibited the activity of partially purified cabbage PLD in a cell-free system in a highly specific manner. Inhibition of PLD by LPE was dose-dependent and increased with the length and unsaturation of the LPE acyl chain whereas individual molecular components of LPE such as ethanolamine and free fatty acid had no effect on PLD activity. Enzyme-kinetic analysis suggested noncompetitive inhibition of PLD by LPE. In comparison, the related lysophospholipids such as lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylglycerol, and lysophosphotidylserine had no significant effect on PLD activity whereas PLD was stimulated by lysophosphatidic acid and inhibited by lysophosphatidylinositol. Membrane-associated and soluble PLD, extracted from cabbage and castor bean leaf tissues, also was inhibited by LPE. Consistent with acyl-specific inhibition of PLD by LPE, senescence of cranberry fruits as measured by ethylene production was more effectively inhibited according to the increasing acyl chain length and unsaturation of LPE. There are no known specific inhibitors of PLD in plants and animals. We demonstrate specific inhibitory regulation of PLD by a lysophospholipid.",

Free radical fragmentation of methyl palmitate, a test compound, is induced by an open tube furnace. Two series of peaks corresponding to bond breaking from each end of the molecule are analyzed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry and yield precisions of SD(delta-13C) < 0.4 per thousand. Isotope labeling in the carboxyl, terminal, and methyl positions demonstrates the absence of rearrangement during activation and fragmentation. Negligible isotopic fractionation was observed as degree of fragmentation was adjusted by changing pyrolysis temperature. [1-13C]methyl palmitate with overall delta-13C = 4.06 per thousand, yielded values of +457 per thousand for the carboxyl position, in agreement with expectations from the dilution, and an average of -27.95 per thousand for the rest of the molecule, corresponding to -27.46 per thousand for the olefin series.

         "It is expected that any irreducible polynomial with integer coefficients assumes infinitely many prime values provided that it satisfies some obvious local conditions. Moreover, it is expected that the frequency of these primes obeys a simple asymptotic law. This has however been proven for only a few special classes of polynomials. In the most famous unsolved cases the sequence of values is \"thin\" in the sense that it contains fewer than N(theta) integers up to N for some constant theta < 1. Quite generally it seems to be difficult to show the infinitude of primes in a given thin integer sequence and there is no polynomial for which this has hitherto been done. The polynomial x(2) + y(4) is an example of such a thin sequence; here, specifically, theta = 3/4. We report here the development of new methods that rigorously demonstrate the asymptotic formula in the case of this polynomial and that are applicable to an infinite class of polynomials to which this one belongs. The proof is based partly on a new sieve method that breaks the well-known parity problem of sieve theory and partly on a careful harmonic analysis of the special properties of biquadratic polynomial sequences.",

         "Pathogenic and sexual development of the fungus Ustilago maydis, the causal agent of corn smut disease, is regulated by heterodimerization of two unrelated homeodomain proteins bE and bW, both encoded by the multi-allelic b mating-type locus. This complex can only be formed if the two proteins are derived from different alleles. The heterodimer is believed to function as a transcriptional regulator that binds to target sites upstream of developmentally regulated genes. We have synthesized a translational fusion in which bE is tethered to bW by a designed flexible kink region. U. maydis strains expressing this synthetic b-fusion become pathogenic for corn illustrating that the single-chain fusion substitutes for the active bE/bW heterodimer. Synthetic b-fusions in which bE and bW originate from the same allele as well as fusions deleted for the dimerization domains were shown to be active while both homeodomains were required for function. Such active fusion proteins are expected to be instrumental in the identification of pathogenicity genes.",

Significant effects on the intrinsic rate of increase are seen in 54 of the 84 species. These effects are far more common than interspecific effects, and are predominantly of the type that should maintain tree diversity. As a result, the more diverse an area in the forest is, the higher is the overall rate of increase of the trees in that area, although sheer crowding has by itself a negative effect. These findings are consistent with, but do not prove, an important role for host-pathogen interactions (defined broadly) in the maintenance of diversity.

         "Light intensities that limit electron flow induce rapid degradation of the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center D1 protein. The mechanism of this phenomenon is not known. We propose that at low excitation rates back electron flow and charge recombination between the QB*- or QA*- semiquinone acceptors and the oxidized S(2,3) states of the PSII donor side may cause oxidative damage via generation of active oxygen species. Therefore, damage per photochemical event should increase with decreasing rates of PSII excitation. To test this hypothesis, the effect of the dark interval between single turnover flashes on the inactivation of water oxidation, charge separation and recombination, and the degradation of D1 protein were determined in spinach thylakoids. PSII inactivation per flash increases as the dark interval between the flashes increases, and a plateau is reached at dark intervals, allowing complete charge recombination of the QB*-/S2,3 or QA*-/S2 states (about 200 and 40 s, respectively). At these excitation rates: (i) 0.7% and 0.4% of PSII is inactivated and 0.4% and 0.2% of the D1 protein is degraded per flash, respectively, and (ii) the damage per flash is about 2 orders of magnitude higher than that induced by equal amount of energy delivered by excess continuous light. No PSII damage occurs if flashes are given in anaerobic conditions. These results demonstrate that charge recombination in active PSII is promoted by low rates of excitation and may account for a the high quantum efficiency of the rapid turnover of the D1 protein induced by limiting light.",

         "Redox-controlled phosphorylation of thylakoid membrane proteins represents a unique system for the regulation of light energy utilization in photosynthesis. The molecular mechanisms for this process remain unknown, but current views suggest that the plastoquinone pool directly controls the activation of the kinase. On the basis of enzyme activation by a pH shift in the darkness combined with flash photolysis, EPR, and optical spectroscopy we propose that activation occurs when plastoquinol occupies the quinol-oxidation (Qo) site of the cytochrome bf complex, having its high-potential path components in a reduced state. A linear correlation between kinase activation and accessibility of the Qo site to plastoquinol was established by quantification of the shift in the g(y) EPR signal of the Rieske Fe-S center resulting from displacement of the Qo-site plastoquinol by a quinone analog. Activity persists as long as one plastoquinol per cytochrome bf is still available. Withdrawal of one electron from this plastoquinol after a single-turnover flash exciting photosystem I leads to deactivation of the kinase parallel with a decrease in the g(z) EPR signal of the reduced Rieske Fe-S center. Cytochrome f, plastocyanin, and P(700) are rereduced after the flash, indicating that the plastoquinol at the Qo site is limiting in maintaining the kinase activity. These results give direct evidence for a functional cytochrome bf-kinase interaction, analogous to a signal transduction system where the cytochrome bf is the receptor and the ligand is the plastoquinol at the Qo site.",

         "We have shown that envelope membranes from spinach chloroplasts contain (i) semiquinone and flavosemiquinone radicals, (ii) a series of iron-containing electron-transfer centers, and (iii) flavins (mostly FAD) loosely associated with proteins. In contrast, we were unable to detect any cytochrome in spinach chloroplast envelope membranes. In addition to a high spin [1Fe]3+ type protein associated with an EPR signal at g = 4.3, we observed two iron-sulfur centers, a [4Fe-4S]1+ and a [2Fe-2S]1+, associated with features, respectively, at g = 1.921 and g = 1.935, which were detected after reduction by NADPH and NADH, respectively. The [4Fe-4S] center, but not the [2Fe-2S] center, was also reduced by dithionite or 5-deazaflavin/oxalate. An unusual Fe-S center, named X, associated with a signal at g = 2.057, was also detected, which was reduced by dithionite but not by NADH or NADPH. Extremely fast spin-relaxation rates of flavin- and quinone-free radicals suggest their close proximity to the [4Fe-4S] cluster or the high-spin [1Fe]3+ center. Envelope membranes probably contain enzymatic activities involved in the formation and reduction of semiquinone radicals (quinol oxidase, NADPH-quinone, and NADPH-semiquinone reductases). The physiological significance of our results is discussed with respect to (i) the presence of desaturase activities in envelope membranes and (ii) the mechanisms involved in the export of protons to the cytosol, which partially regulate the stromal pH during photosynthesis. The characterization of such a wide variety of electron carriers in envelope membranes opens new fields of research on the functions of this membrane system within the plant cell.",

The approach combines organic synthesis, to independently prepare reactant and product, with the low detection limits of confocally adjusted fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Selective detection of disfavored products is achieved by designing a system in which the analyte displays a unique absorption and emission of light. This was accomplished through application of a substance-selective intramolecular charge transfer.

In conjunction with concurrent 1H-NMR monitoring, the relative abundance of major and disfavored reaction products can be determined and used to calculate the energetics of processes disfavored by more than 5 kcal/mol.",

         "Ecosystem processes are thought to depend on both the number and identity of the species present in an ecosystem, but mathematical theory predicting this has been lacking. Here we present three simple models of interspecific competitive interactions in communities containing various numbers of randomly chosen species. All three models predict that, on average, productivity increases asymptotically with the original biodiversity of a community. The two models that address plant nutrient competition also predict that ecosystem nutrient retention increases with biodiversity and that the effects of biodiversity on productivity and nutrient retention increase with interspecific differences in resource requirements. All three models show that both species identity and biodiversity simultaneously influence ecosystem functioning, but their relative importance varies greatly among the models. This theory reinforces recent experimental results and shows that effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning are predicted by well-known ecological processes.",

         "We have developed a new plant vector system for repeated transformation (called MAT for multi-auto-transformation) in which a chimeric ipt gene, inserted into the transposable element Ac, is used as a selectable marker for transformation. Selectable marker genes conferring antibiotic or herbicide resistance, used to introduce economically valuable genes into crop plants, have three major problems: (i) the selective agents have negative effects on proliferation and differentiation of plant cells; (ii) there is uncertainty regarding the environmental impact of many selectable marker genes; (iii) it is difficult to perform recurrent transformations using the same selectable marker to pyramid desirable genes. The MAT vector system containing the ipt gene and the Ac element is designed to overcome these difficulties. When tobacco leaf segments were transformed and selected, subsequent excision of the modified Ac produced marker-free transgenic tobacco plants without sexual crosses or seed production. In addition, the chimeric ipt gene could be visually used as a selectable marker for transformation of hybrid aspen (Populus sieboldii x Populus grandidentata). The chimeric ipt gene, therefore, is an attractive alternative to the most widely used selectable marker genes. The MAT vector system provides a promising way to shorten breeding time for genetically engineered crops. This method could be particularly valuable for fruit and forest trees, for which long generation times are a more significant barrier to breeding and genetic analysis.",

         "We provide evidence that the tripeptide thiol glutathione (GSH) participates in the regulation of cell division in the apical meristem of Arabidopsis roots. Exogenous application of micromolar concentrations of GSH raised the number of meristematic cells undergoing mitosis, while depletion of GSH had the opposite effect. A role for endogenous GSH in the control of cell proliferation is also provided by mapping of GSH levels in the root meristem using the GSH-specific dye monochlorobimane and confocal laser scanning microscopy. High levels of GSH were associated with the epidermal and cortical initials and markedly lower levels in the quiescent center. The mechanisms controlling cell division could also be triggered by other reducing agents: ascorbic acid and dithiothreitol. Our data also reveal significant plasticity in the relationship between the trichoblast cell length and the hair it subtends in response to alterations in intracellular redox homeostasis. While mechanisms that control trichoblast elongation are influenced by nonspecific redox couples, root hair tip growth has a more specific requirement for sulfhydryl groups. The responses we describe here may represent the extremes of redox control of root plasticity and would allow the root to maintain exploration of the soil under adverse conditions with minimal cell divisions and root hair production or capitalize on a favorable environment by production of numerous long hairs. Redox sensing of the environment and subsequent redox-dependent modulation of growth and development may be crucial components in the strategies plants have evolved for survival in a fluctuating environment.",

         "Ethylene inhibits hypocotyl elongation in etiolated Arabidopsis seedlings. However, when Arabidopsis was grown in the light in the presence of ethylene or its precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), a marked induction of hypocotyl elongation occurred. This resulted from an increase in cell expansion rather than cell division. The effects of ethylene and ACC were antagonized by the ethylene action inhibitor Ag+. The elongation response was absent or weakened in a set of ethylene-insensitive mutants (etr1-3, ein2-1, ein3-1, ein4, ain1-10, ein7). With the exception of ein4, the degree of inhibition of hypocotyl elongation was correlated with the strength of the ethylene-insensitive phenotype based on the triple response assay. In addition, the constitutive ethylene response mutant ctr1-1, grown in the light, had a longer hypocotyl than the wild type. Exogenous auxin also induced hypocotyl elongation in light-grown Arabidopsis. Again, the response was abolished by treatment with Ag+, suggesting that ethylene might be a mediator. The results showed that, depending on light conditions, ethylene can induce opposite effects on cell expansion in Arabidopsis hypocotyls.",

         "Pathogen recognition at the plant cell surface typically results in the initiation of a multicomponent defense response. Transient influx of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane is postulated to be part of the signaling chain leading to pathogen resistance. Patch-clamp analysis of parsley protoplasts revealed a novel Ca2+-permeable, La3+-sensitive plasma membrane ion channel of large conductance (309 pS in 240 mM CaCl2). At an extracellular Ca2+ concentration of 1 mM, which is representative of the plant cell apoplast, unitary channel conductance was determined to be 80 pS. This ion channel (LEAC, for large conductance elicitor-activated ion channel) is reversibly activated upon treatment of parsley protoplasts with an oligopeptide elicitor derived from a cell wall protein of Phytophthora sojae. Structural features of the elicitor found previously to be essential for receptor binding, induction of defense-related gene expression, and phytoalexin formation are identical to those required for activation of LEAC. Thus, receptor-mediated stimulation of this channel appears to be causally involved in the signaling cascade triggering pathogen defense in parsley.",

         "The need to assess the randomness of a single sequence, especially a finite sequence, is ubiquitous, yet is unaddressed by axiomatic probability theory. Here, we assess randomness via approximate entropy (ApEn), a computable measure of sequential irregularity, applicable to single sequences of both (even very short) finite and infinite length. We indicate the novelty and facility of the multidimensional viewpoint taken by ApEn, in contrast to classical measures. Furthermore and notably, for finite length, finite state sequences, one can identify maximally irregular sequences, and then apply ApEn to quantify the extent to which given sequences differ from maximal irregularity, via a set of deficit (def(m)) functions. The utility of these def(m) functions which we show allows one to considerably refine the notions of probabilistic independence and normality, is featured in several studies, including (i) digits of e, pi, radical2, and radical3, both in base 2 and in base 10, and (ii) sequences given by fractional parts of multiples of irrationals. We prove companion analytic results, which also feature in a discussion of the role and validity of the almost sure properties from axiomatic probability theory insofar as they apply to specified sequences and sets of sequences (in the physical world). We conclude by relating the present results and perspective to both previous and subsequent studies.",

         "The risk of rapid pest adaptation to an insecticide is highly dependent on the initial frequency of resistance alleles in field populations. Because we have lacked empirical estimates of these frequencies, population-genetic models of resistance evolution have relied on a wide range of theoretical estimates. The recent commercialization of genetically engineered cotton that constitutively produces an insecticidal protein derived from the biocontrol agent, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) has raised concern that we lack data needed to quantify the risk of insect pests such as Heliothis virescens rapidly adapting to this ecologically valuable class of toxins. By individually mating over 2,000 male H. virescens moths collected in four states to females of a Bt toxin-resistant laboratory strain, and screening F1 and F2 offspring for tolerance of the toxic protein, we were able to directly estimate the field frequency of alleles for resistance as 1.5 x 10(-3). This high initial frequency underscores the need for caution in deploying transgenic cotton to control insect pests. Our single-pair mating technique greatly increases the efficiency of detecting recessive resistance alleles. Because alleles that decrease target site sensitivity to Bt toxins and other insecticides are often recessive, this technique could be useful in estimating resistance allele frequencies in other insects exposed to transgenic insecticidal crops or conventional insecticides.",

         "We present a model of a financial market in which naive diversification, based simply on portfolio size and obtained as a consequence of the law of large numbers, is distinguished from efficient diversification, based on mean-variance analysis. This distinction yields a valuation formula involving only the essential risk embodied in an asset's return, where the overall risk can be decomposed into a systematic and an unsystematic part, as in the arbitrage pricing theory; and the systematic component further decomposed into an essential and an inessential part, as in the capital-asset-pricing model. The two theories are thus unified, and their individual asset-pricing formulas shown to be equivalent to the pervasive economic principle of no arbitrage. The factors in the model are endogenously chosen by a procedure analogous to the Karhunen-Loéve expansion of continuous time stochastic processes; it has an optimality property justifying the use of a relatively small number of them to describe the underlying correlational structures. Our idealized limit model is based on a continuum of assets indexed by a hyperfinite Loeb measure space, and it is asymptotically implementable in a setting with a large but finite number of assets. Because the difficulties in the formulation of the law of large numbers with a standard continuum of random variables are well known, the model uncovers some basic phenomena not amenable to classical methods, and whose approximate counterparts are not already, or even readily, apparent in the asymptotic setting.",

The model alloy used was the transparent organic crystal succinonitrile doped with the laser dye coumarin 152. The buildup of solute ahead of the initially stable planar interface and the subsequent instability of the planar front were measured in detail and compared with recent theoretical calculations by Warren and Langer [Warren, J. A. & Langer, J. S. (1993) Phys. Rev. E 47, 2702- 2712]. The fluorescence of coumarin 152 was used for direct observations of the evolution of the solute concentration profile ahead of the initially planar solid-liquid interface. UV absorption was used to produce thermal perturbations of the sample that generated spatially periodic modulations of the planar interface. This technique allows for measurement of both positive and negative linear growth coefficients (determined from the growth or decay rate of the modulation after the perturbation is switched off) for a large range of wave vectors. Measurements of the evolution of the concentration profile and the linear growth coefficients, and the occurrence of the initial instability, were in good agreement with the Warren-Langer predictions.",

         "A series of experiments, in which nine participants trade an asset over 15 periods, test the hypothesis that an initial imbalance of asset/cash will influence the trading price over an extended time. Participants know at the outset that the asset or \"stock\" pays a single dividend with fixed expectation value at the end of the 15th period. In experiments with a greater total value of cash at the start, the mean prices during the trading periods are higher, compared with those with greater amount of asset, with a high degree of statistical significance. The difference is most significant at the outset and gradually tapers near the end of the experiment. The results are very surprising from a rational expectations and classical game theory perspective, because the possession of a large amount of cash does not lead to a simple motivation for a trader to bid excessively on a financial instrument. The gradual erosion of the difference toward the end of trading, however, suggests that fundamental value is approached belatedly, offering some consolation to the rational expectations theory. It also suggests that there is a time scale on which an evolution toward fundamental value occurs. The experimental results are qualitatively compatible with the price dynamics predicted by a system of differential equations based on asset flow. The results have broad implications for the marketing of securities, particularly initial and secondary public offerings, government bonds, etc., where excess supply has been conjectured to suppress prices.",

         "\n          The latissimus dorsi flap is widely used in plastic surgery for covering the upper limb but also for reconstruction the function of the elbow or shoulder. We describe a case of a sarcoma of the anterior compartment of the arm, the surgical removal then the covering and reconstruction of the elbow flexion. This case was carried out by a unipolar pedicled flap of the latissimus dorsi.\n          Three steps were performed (excision, flap preparation and flap fixation). The functional results (muscle strength, MRC scale) and range of motion (ROM) were analyzed. We performed a small literature review to compare the results.\n          A complete excision (R0) was carried out with a good vitality of the latissimus dorsi flap. A rapid scarring was obtained, allowing an early start of adjuvant radiotherapy. Muscular strength was 33% less compared to preoperative, MRC scale was classified 4. ROM of the elbow was rated at -10/0/130. One year after the operation, the patient is still in remission.\n          Our functional results are comparable to those found in the literature. The muscle strength in our case appears to be superior, probably linked to a brachio-radialis muscle still functional. No difference in function has been found in the literature between a unipolar or a bipolar transfer of the latissimus dorsi. This case report confirms the reliable and effective nature of the latissimus dorsi flap. The use of this flap for reconstruction after sarcoma surgery has only few reports in the literature.\n        ",

         "\n          To analyze the effect of tooth loss/periodontitis on disease activity in early and established rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\n          Participants of the Course And Prognosis of Early Arthritis (CAPEA) early arthritis cohort reported their number of teeth at baseline. The number of teeth had been validated as a predictor of periodontitis. Clinical end points, including disease activity score (Disease Activity Score in 28 joints using the erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]), swollen joint count (SJC), ESR, and C-reactive protein level were collected at baseline, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. We used linear mixed regression models to estimate the association between tooth loss and clinical end points over time in early arthritis. For established RA, we analyzed cross-sectional data from the German National Database (NDB). All models accounted for age, sex, smoking, seropositivity, education level, and disease duration (only NDB).\n          Among 1,124 CAPEA participants with early arthritis, those with higher tooth loss were older, more often male, smokers, and seropositive, and they had higher disease activity and inflammation markers at baseline. Tooth loss was associated with higher disease activity and ESR values over time. Inflammatory markers decreased comparably across tooth loss categories. Glucocorticoid use was higher among those with more tooth loss, whereas dose reduction was similar across tooth loss categories. Among 7,179 NDB participants with longstanding RA, disease activity and inflammation markers but not SJC were significantly higher in patients with more tooth loss.\n          Although we observed an association between tooth loss and disease activity scores and inflammation markers in early and established RA, longitudinal results suggest that tooth loss does not hamper treatment response.\n          © 2021 The Authors.

         "\n          The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has forced a rapid and extensive change in the need of intensive care beds. Therefore, we decided early in the pandemic to suspend all elective cases of cardiac surgery and closed the ambulatory clinic. The effect of this strategy on the mental well-being of the non-COVID-19 patients is unknown. The aim of this study is to assess whether planned or operated patients suffered from either anxiety or depression by their altered medical care trajectory and if their score influenced decision-making. The findings intend to anticipate individual needs during subsequent waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n          The patient population consisted of two groups. The first group included planned patients whose operation date was delayed; in the second group, the postoperative control visit was postponed. Both groups received a twofold questionnaire. Part one was the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale, part two a series of questions on the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on cardiac surgical care from a patient's perspective.\n          The study population was composed of 46 patients (63% men). Most of them (82.6%) would like the surgery to be performed as fast as possible, even before the end of the first wave of COVID-19-related hospitalizations. Of all patients 30.4% have avoided to consult a physician because of fear and 34.8% consulted a physician by phone call. When they physically consulted a physician, there was a prominent role for the general practitioner (41.3% went to the GP vs 19.6% to the specialist). Most (58.7%) of the patients would have liked a (tele)consultation with the cardiac surgeon.\n          Regardless of the HADS, one can state that a closer follow-up using telemedicine during the pandemic is expected by all patients. All patients prefer their surgery to take place even during a pandemic.\n        ",

Results for patients receiving EDS-FLU (186 µg [n = 161] or 372 µg [n = 160]) or EDS-placebo (n = 161) twice daily during the double-blind phase are described. Responder criteria included NP grade reduction (≥1-point), 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) reduction (>12-points), Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) (much/very much improved), and congestion score improvement (>0.5-points).\n          More patients in the EDS-FLU group responded to each of the four responder criteria compared with EDS-placebo. More patients receiving EDS-FLU responded to ≥ 1 criterion compared with EDS-placebo at week 4 (82.7% and 60.4%, respectively) and week 16 (95.7% and 80.3%, respectively). Patients responded similarly irrespective of prior sinus surgery or prior INS use. Patient-reported outcome measures showed earlier responses than NP scores.\n          Meaningful improvements were seen across multiple response criteria with EDS-FLU, suggesting that the broad treatment effect of EDS-FLU includes objective reduction in polyp grade and improvements in several patient-reported outcomes.\n          ClinicalTrials.gov (NAVIGATE I: NCT01622569 and NAVIGATE II: NCT01624662).\n        ",

Surgical treatments, including Open Partial Horizontal Laryngectomy (OPHL), are often followed by long-lasting swallowing rehabilitation and more rarely, persistent dysphagia. Some authors reported single cases, successfully treated with fat injection of the base of tongue, but nowadays, a standardized technique has never been described so far. We provide a step-by-step technique description of the trans-cervical lipofilling of the base of the tongue (BOT) under local anaesthesia in a case series of three patients. The functional results have been evaluated with a videofluoroscopic study of deglutition and Penetration-Aspiration Score. The procedure was well tolerated; all patients were discharged after 24 hours without any majorcomplications. After six months, all patients had a steady improvement in swallowing. During follow-up, the videofluoroscopic study of deglutition confirmed a sensitive amelioration of the Penetration-Aspiration Score and an empowered base of tongue retropulsion. Finally, the lipofilling of the BOT under local anaesthesia showed to be a feasible, and reproducible procedure, for dysphagia after OPHLs.\n        ",

         "\n          Anti-social behavior and violence are major public health concerns. Globally, violence contributes to more than 1.6 million deaths each year. Previous studies have reported that social rejection or neglect exacerbates aggression. In rodent models, social isolation stress is used to demonstrate the adverse effects of social deprivation on physiological, endocrinological, immunological, and behavioral parameters, including aggressive behavior. This review summarizes recent rodent studies on the effect of social isolation stress during different developmental periods on aggressive behavior and the underlying neural mechanisms. Social isolation during adulthood affects the levels of neurosteroids and neuropeptides and increases aggressive behavior. These changes are ethologically relevant for the adaptation to changes in local environmental conditions in the natural habitats. Chronic deprivation of social interaction after weaning, especially during the juvenile to adolescent periods, leads to the disruption of the development of appropriate social behavior and the maladaptive escalation of aggressive behavior. The understanding of neurobiological mechanisms underlying social isolation-induced escalated aggression will aid in the development of therapeutic interventions for escalated aggression.\n          Copyright © 2022 Japan Neuroscience Society and Elsevier Ltd.

The cognitive model of depression proposes that biased negative memory is a crucial determinant in the development of mental stress-induced disorders. Accumulating evidence from both clinical and animal studies has demonstrated that such biased memory processing could be triggered by the hippocampus, a region well known to be involved in declarative memories. This review mainly describes how memory-related neurophysiological mechanisms in the hippocampus and their interactions with other related brain regions are involved in the regulation of stress susceptibility and discusses potential interventions to prevent and treat stress-related psychiatric symptoms. Further neurophysiological insights based on memory mechanisms are expected to devise personalized prevention and therapy to confer stress resilience.\n          Copyright © 2022 Japan Neuroscience Society and Elsevier Ltd.

The intervention group received a psychoeducational support training program for stress management through six online group sessions (each 35-45 minutes) in a week. An expert psychiatric nurse provided this program on WhatsApp immediately after the patient's discharge from the hospital. The participants completed the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14) before starting the intervention and 1 week after that. Data analysis was conducted by descriptive and inferential statistics, including Chi-square, Fisher's exact test, independent, and paired t-test.\n          Both groups were homogeneous in terms of demographic variables of survivors and caregivers. In terms of the PSS, there was no significant difference between the two groups before the intervention (p=0.28). The pre- and post-intervention scores of PSS in the intervention group were 39.57 ± 5.89 and 35.48 ± 5.68, respectively, indicating a significant decrease (p<0.001). Also, the pre- and post-intervention differences between the intervention and control groups were -4.08 ± 3.52 and -0.11 ± 2.66, respectively, indicating a greater decrease in the total PSS of the intervention group (p < 0.001).\n          The family caregivers of COVID-19 survivors suffered from psychological distress during their patient care.

         "\n          When a pet dies, owners can experience similar levels of grief as when a human dies. Previous research indicates the role of continuing bonds (CB) when a pet is alive. To understand the impact of these bonds after the pet has died, we conducted a systematic narrative synthesis according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (PRISMA). Findings were heterogenous, yet there were still parallels in the literature. CB can sometimes aggravate and intensify grief experiences, particularly when pet grief is perceived as disenfranchised grief. However, identifying appropriate bonds can be useful to moderate the intensity of grief and be a valuable mechanism of support. CB can also help post-traumatic growth of owners.\n        ",

         "\n          Dropped head syndrome (DHS) is a recently recognised cause of cervical spinal deformity and disability. The combination of Parkinson's disease (PD) and inflammatory myopathy in the genesis of DHS has not been previously reported. Furthermore, the optimal surgical treatment of progressive DHS remains undefined.\n          We report the case of a 64-year-old patient with severe DHS and coronal plane deformity secondary to underlying PD, precipitated by a focal paraspinal myositis, successfully corrected using asymmetric sternocleidomastoid (SCM) release and circumferential cervical fusion. The nuances of decision-making in this challenging patient population are highlighted, including the benefits of intraoperative traction, anterior column reconstruction and bicortical screw fixation. Postoperatively, significant reductions in pain and disability were achieved, along with restoration of cervical lordosis (CL), C2-7 sagittal vertical axis (CSVA) and chin-brow vertical angle (CBVA).\n          Circumferential cervical fusion with concomitant SCM release is a useful option in the treatment of recalcitrant DHS with biplanar deformity, addressing the unique biomechanical and endocrinological challenges posed by patients with underlying PD.\n        ",

         "\n          Major depressive disorder, one of the most widespread mental illnesses, brings about enormous individual and socioeconomic consequences. Conventional monoaminergic antidepressants require weeks to months to produce a therapeutic response, and approximately one-third of the patients fail to respond to these drugs and are considered treatment-resistant. Although recent studies have demonstrated that ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, produces rapid antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant patients, it also has undesirable side effects. Hence, rapid-acting antidepressants that have fewer adverse effects than ketamine are urgently required. D-series (RvD1-RvD6) and E-series (RvE1-RvE4) resolvins are endogenous lipid mediators derived from docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic acids, respectively. These mediators reportedly play a pivotal role in the resolution of acute inflammation. In this review, we reveal that intracranial infusions of RvD1, RvD2, RvE1, RvE2, and RvE3 produce antidepressant-like effects in various rodent models of depression. Moreover, the behavioral effects of RvD1, RvD2, and RvE1 are mediated by the activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1, which is essential for the antidepressant-like actions of ketamine. Finally, we briefly provide our perspective on the possible role of endogenous resolvins in stress resilience.\n          Copyright © 2022 Japan Neuroscience Society and Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study was to determine which aspects of a good death are most important to Black/Indigenous, and/or people of color (BIPOC). Participants were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk, and then directed to complete a quantitative survey indicating the importance of each item on the Good Death Inventory. A logistic regression model was used to identify any differences in the importance of each item based on the racial background of the respondent. After accounting for other independent variables, the results showed that BIPOC were more likely to indicate that factors such as life completion, receiving all treatment possible, and religious/spiritual support were important aspects of a good death.

         "\n          This narrative study voices the perspectives of a hidden population, spiritual leaders of the Muslim minority in Israel whose leadership in attending to deaths throughout COVID-19 was invalidated. Findings elucidate their dilemmas as being responsible for protecting the community from infection on one hand, and for guiding religious death rituals and preventing disenfranchised grief of families and the community on the other hand. Denying religious minorities their right to conduct traditions in a safe manner and leaving spiritual leaders outside of decision making on shaping COVID-19 guidelines creates distrust and deepens aggravation of enfranchised grief. As the global society is becoming religiously fragmented, distrust of religious minorities in health authorities due to denial of burial of death rituals, funerals, and burials, may have societal consequences and must be considered. Recommendations of this study may assist authorities in creating guidelines that accord with the laws, traditions, and values of religions minorities, empowering their spiritual leaders.\n        ",

Qualitative and quantitative studies were included to understand health practitioners' attitudes and experiences with assisted dying services, as well as to identify the mental health consequences. We identified 18 articles from 1591 articles drawn from seven major scientific databases (i.e., PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus). Two raters independently evaluated the exclusion and inclusion decisions of the articles and examined methodological flaws in the selected articles. We found that engagement in assisted death services were not reliably associated with mental health outcomes such as anxiety and moral distress. Both positive and negative outcomes were reported, and psychological outcomes for practitioners were shown to vary based on factors including social support for health practitioners' views; their perceived capacity to care for the patients; and legislation.\n        ",

Additionally, given how the movies he starred in were easily viewable by audiences stuck at home during the COVID-19 pandemic and given his popularity on digital spaces like Black Twitter, this case offers insights into how media use can help people cope with parasocial grief. We conducted a mixed-methods survey study of audience responses Boseman's death.

Narrative interviews were conducted with 18 respondents (5 males and 13 females) aged 18-75 years who had engaged in self-harm. A case by case analysis was done using descriptive phenomenological method. The details of the narratives are described using the \"suicidal process approach\" proposed by van Heeringens. Comparing the narratives, we observed that most individuals found themselves unable to manage their negative emotions and for some, this situation persisted through multiple episodes. Hence, one of the suicide prevention strategy is to emphasize emotional regulation skills like self-awareness, being mindful and self-compassion in all forms of psychotherapy intervention at all levels.\n        ",

Data was analyzed using SPSS v.25; descriptive statistics, an independent sample t-test, and simple linear regression were applied to the data. The results revealed that men and women are both experiencing cancer-related stigmatization in Pakistan.

         "The Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Grief Experiences of Bereaved Relatives: An Overview Review.",
         "\n          The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted grief experiences of bereaved relatives and altered accustomed ways of coping with loss. To understand how bereaved relatives experienced grief during COVID-19, a review, using the overview method, was conducted. An overview of empirical data about this subject has been lacking and therefore, PubMed and CINAHL databases were searched for empirical studies published from January 1, 2020 until December 31, 2021. 28 articles were included in the review. Thematic analysis showed different emotional responses, changes in grief, the effect of absence during final moments, a lack of involvement in the caring process, the impact on communities and social support systems and the alteration of funerals among bereaved relatives. During COVID-19, death is characterized by poor bereavement outcomes and health implications, but bereaved also show signs of resilience and coping. Directions for future research about cultural and societal differences in grief and support methods are suggested.\n        ",

         "\n          The loss of a child can impact maternal mental health and the emotional development of a subsequent baby. Couple relationship can help women to cope with this loss. This study investigates the association among child loss, maternal mental health (including prolonged grief), couple adjustment, and psycho-functional symptoms in the subsequent babies. 598 Brazilian mothers, recruited by convenience, took part in the study. Mothers with a baby loss (23%) presented greater age and religiosity, less income, a longer couple relationship, and better couple adjustment, and their baby presented a great number of symptoms. This population needs monitoring for early emotional assistance.\n        ",

To examine the research hypotheses, a cross-sectional study was designed and included 122 participants (Mean age = 72.77) drawn from four groups: spouses of people living with mild to moderate cognitive impairment, spouses of people living with advanced cognitive impairment, widowed spouses of deceased dementia patients, and a control group. Participants completed a battery of self-report questionnaires. Results showed that secure attachment constitutes a significant protective factor with regard to bio-psycho-social symptomatology (Track I) as well as difficulties in the relational bond with the spouse and grief over their deterioration (Track II). The results of the research support integrating attachment-based insights into clinical work with spouses coping with the losses accompanying cognitive decline and the grief processes that are operant in these losses.\n        ",

Sociodemographic data form, Psychological Resilience Scale, Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS-11) were used in the study.ResultsIt was found that PRS dedication and challenge are significantly higher in the control group (p = .039 and p = .003, respectively). When the undiagnosed group who attempted suicide were compared with the control group, it was observed that there is a significant difference between BIS-11 total and TAS total after bonferonni correction (respectively; p = .002; p = .001), while, there is no statistically significant difference in terms of PRS total score (p = .483)ConclusionIt was observed that patients who attempted suicide with drugs had low levels of psychological resilience, high alexithymia levels. In the absence of an additional diagnosis of depression, psychological resilience did not differ in terms of suicide attempts. In the suicide group, those who did not receive any additional diagnosis were not more impulsive than those who were depressed.\n        ",

Two hundred ninety-nine relatives of people with cancer participated in a cross-sectional online survey. Participants were included if they spoke German and were 18 years or older. Multivariate regression analysis was conducted. Pre-loss grief was significantly associated with depression (β = .388, p < .001), anxiety (β = .429, p < .001), somatization (β = .221, p < .001) and satisfaction with life (β = -.205, p < .001). Preparedness for death was significantly associated with somatization (β = -.247, p < .001). Results suggest that people with high scores in pre-loss grief and low scores in preparedness for death are in need of early support. Interventions should address pre-loss grief and the various aspects of preparedness for death and take into account the psychological health in relatives of people with cancer.

The purpose is to explore the relationship between the prolonged grief (PG) symptoms and the post-traumatic growth (PTG) of recently bereaved people during the COVID-19 period, and the mediating role of meaning making. 305 participants were recruited to complete the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory, Inventory of Complicated Grief, and Integration of Stressful Life Experiences Scale. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses and Medcurve in SPSS were adapted to test the hypotheses. The results revealed that there was a curvilinear relationship between PG and PTG and meaning making had a completely mediating effect on this relationship. Different intervention goals - whether alleviating distress or cultivating growth - should be set up according to the level of grief for recently bereaved individuals during COVID-19.

The purpose of this study was to document the time commitment of EOLDs to dying persons and their loved ones during the dying process, as well as their experiences navigating family dynamics working towards increased acceptance of death. A mixed-methods approach was utilized to gather data on EOLDs, consisting of a quantitative survey with 618 respondents and subsequent qualitative interviews conducted with 39 participants. Results indicated that the amount of time spent with dying persons and their loved ones varies widely and often depends on when the EOLD is contracted regarding services. Factors that impede and lead to great acceptance of death are discussed as well as the role of EOLDs in navigating family dynamics.\n        ",

However, no studies have examined how mourners have been coping with grief and which strategies may buffer negative mental health consequences. We examined the various coping strategies being used and which strategies best support quality of life. Participants completed self-report measures of demographic and loss-related characteristics, grief symptoms, quality of life (QOL), and coping strategies used. Despite help-seeking being one of the least endorsed coping strategies used, help-seeking was the only coping strategy that buffered the impact of grief on QOL for individuals with high grief severity.

We then discuss what kinds of information viewers may be taking from these series. Our deductive content analysis suggests that much of the messages obtained are fairly representative of what occurs in real hospital settings, with the exception of emotional display. From the inductive analysis, we identified four thematic categories: 'the person dies, but life goes on', 'the tragic death', 'the purposeful death', and 'the well-timed death'. Regardless of category, no rituals are conducted at the moment of death and little space is made for grieving on primetime medical television shows.

An online survey assessed grief using the Adult Attitude to Grief (AAG) scale, which calculates an overall index of vulnerability (IOV) (range 0-36), and practical and emotional support needs in 13 domains. Participants' mean age was 49.5 (SD 12.9); 628 (88.6%) female. Mean age of deceased 72.2 (SD 16.1). 311 (43.8%) deaths were from confirmed/suspected COVID-19. High overall levels of grief and support needs were observed; 28.2% exhibited severe vulnerability (index of vulnerability ≥24). Grief and support needs were higher for close relationships with the deceased (vs. more distant) and reported social isolation and loneliness (p < 0.001), and lower when age of deceased was above 40-50.

The highest burden of stillbirths (97%) and newborn deaths (98%) occurs in lower- and middle-income countries, with the majority occurring in Sub-Saharan African countries. Method: This cross-sectional qualitative study was conducted to identify existing policies and protocols to support bereaved families, explore the needs of bereaved families, and to also assess the impact of perinatal death on families in Ghana. All in-depth interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed thematically. The results were presented in narratives and supported with illustrative quotes from respondents. Results: In all, 42 in-depth interviews were conducted with 10 (23.8%) from the Northern belt (Upper East), 11 (26.2%) from the middle belt (Ashanti) and 21 (50.0%) from the Southern belt (Greater Accra). The study revealed that practicing health professionals and other stakeholders within the health service delivery chain were not aware of protocols, written guidelines or written documents to initiate counseling at the facility in the event of a mother losing a child. Most of the respondents did not know what to do in the event that a mother loses a baby during delivery or immediately after. Respondents were in favor of having a policy or guidelines which will help them to counsel families who go through perinatal bereavement. Respondents were of the view that it is important for families who experience perinatal grief to be supported. Conclusion: All staff who meet the pregnant mother during her pre-and-post-delivery stages should be trained on the use of guidelines or policies. There is the need to have a policy, train and equip health staff to ensure that families experiencing perinatal grief are provided with effective counseling. Ghana Health Service should consider training and recruiting professional counselors who will support the health staff in dealing with perinatal grief.\n        ",

         "\n          Individual variability of stress susceptibility led to the concept of stress resilience to adapt well upon stressors. However, the neural mechanisms of stress resilience and its relevance to antidepressant actions remain elusive. In rodents, chronic stress induces dendritic atrophy and decreases dendritic spine density in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), recapitulating prefrontal alterations in depressive patients, and the mPFC promotes stress resilience. Whereas dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens potentiated by chronic stress promote stress susceptibility, dopamine neurons projecting to the mPFC activated upon acute stress contribute to dendritic growth of mPFC neurons via dopamine D1 receptors, leading to stress resilience. Rodent studies have also identified the roles of prefrontal D1 receptors as well as D1 receptor-expressing mPFC neurons projecting to multiple subcortical areas and dendritic spine formation in the mPFC for the sustained antidepressant-like effects of low-dose ketamine. Thus, understanding the cellular and neural-circuit mechanism of prefrontal D1 receptor actions paves the way for bridging the gap between stress resilience and the sustained antidepressant-like effects. The mechanistic understanding of stress resilience might be exploitable for developing antidepressants based on a naturally occurring mechanism, thus safer than low-dose ketamine.\n          Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd and Japan Neuroscience Society.

The questionnaire was composed of FC background characteristics, perceived-burden, satisfaction with the community-home-care services, depression, and confidence in the provision of care to the PWESD. HCUs' FC felt significantly more burdened than HHUs' FC. Furthermore, satisfaction with the community-home-care services mediated the relationship between FC confidence in the provision of care to the PWESD and FC burden. The study results may affect the development of end-of-life care policies and services which meet the needs of PWESD and their FC.\n        ",

         "\n          Coordinated network activity, particularly in circuits arising from the prefrontal cortex innervating the ventral striatum, is crucial for normal processing of reward-related information which is perturbed in several psychiatric disorders characterized by dysregulated reward-related behaviors. Stress-induced depression and substance use disorders (SUDs) both share this common underlying pathology, manifested as deficits in perceived reward in depression, and increased attribution of positive valence to drug-predictive stimuli and dysfunctional cognition in SUDs. Here we review preclinical and clinical data that support dysregulation of motivated and reward-related behaviors as a core phenotype shared between these two disorders. We posit that altered processing of reward-related stimuli arises from dysregulated control of subcortical circuits by upstream regions implicated in executive control. Although multiple circuits are directly involved in reward processing, here we focus specifically on the role of corticostriatal circuit dysregulation. Moreover, we highlight the growing body of evidence indicating that such abnormalities may be due to heightened neuroimmune signaling by microglia, and that targeting the neuroimmune system may be a viable approach to treating this shared symptom.\n          Copyright © 2023.

         "\n          Goal directed fluid therapy (GDFT) may be a rational approach to adopt in neurosurgical patients, in whom intravascular volume optimization is of utmost importance. Most of the parameters used to guide GDFT are derived invasively. We postulated that the total volume of intraoperative intravenous fluid administered during elective craniotomy for supratentorial brain tumours would be comparable between two groups receiving GDFT guided either by the non-invasively derived plethysmography variability index (PVI) or by stroke volume variation (SVV).\n          60 ASA category 1, 2 and 3 patients between 18 and 70 years of age were randomized to receive intraoperative fluid guided either by SVV (SVV group; n = 31) or PVI (PVI group; n = 29). The total volume of fluid administered intraoperatively was recorded. Serum creatinine was measured before the surgery, at the end of the surgery, 24 h after surgery and on the fifth post-operative day. Arterial cannulation was performed before induction in all patients. Serum lactate was measured before induction, once in 2 h intraoperatively, at the end of the surgery and 24 h after the surgery. Brain relaxation score was assessed by the surgeon during dural opening and dural closure. Patients were followed up till discharge or death. The duration of mechanical ventilation and the duration of hospital stay was noted for all patients.\n          The volume of fluid given intraoperatively was significantly higher in the SVV group (p = 0.005). The two groups were comparable with respect to serum lactate and serum creatinine measured at pre-determined time intervals. Brain relaxation score was also comparable between the groups. SVV and PVI displayed moderate to strong correlation intraoperatively. The duration of mechanical ventilation and the length of the hospital stay were comparable between the two groups.\n          PVI and SVV are equally effective in guiding GDFT in adults undergoing elective craniotomy for supratentorial brain tumours.\n        ",

         "Management of brain tumour related epilepsy (BTRE): a narrative review and therapy recommendations.",
         "\n          Brain Tumour Related Epilepsy (BTRE) has a significant impact on Quality of Life with implications for driving, employment, and social activities. Management of BTRE is complex due to the higher incidence of drug resistance and the potential for interaction between anti-cancer therapy and anti-seizure medications (ASMs). Neurologists, neurosurgeons, oncologists, palliative care physicians and clinical nurse specialists treating these patients would benefit from up-to-date clinical guidelines. We aim to review the current literature and to outline specific recommendations for the optimal treatment of BTRE, encompassing both Primary Brain Tumours (PBT) and Brain Metastases (BM). A comprehensive search of the literature since 1995 on BTRE was carried out in PubMed, MEDLINE and EMCARE. A broad search strategy was used, and the evidence evaluated and graded based on the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence. Seizure frequency varies between 10 and 40% in patients with Brain Metastases (BM) and from 30% (high-grade gliomas) to 90% (low-grade gliomas) in patients with PBT. In patients with BM, risk factors include number of BM and melanoma histology. In patients with PBT, BTRE is more common in patients with lower grade histology, frontal and temporal tumours, presence of an IDH mutation and cortical infiltration. All patients with BTRE should be treated with ASMs. Non-enzyme inducing ASMs are recommended as first line treatment for BTRE, but up to 50% of patients with BTRE due to PBT remain resistant. There is no proven benefit for the use of prophylactic ASMs, although there are no randomised trials testing newer agents. Surgical and oncological treatments i.e. radiotherapy and chemotherapy improve BTRE. Vagus Nerve Stimulation has been used with partial success. The review highlights the relative dearth of high-quality evidence for the management of BTRE and provides a framework for further studies aiming to improve seizure control, quality of life, and indications for ASMs.\n        ",

         "What Should Enforcement Do, and Not Do?",
         "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               Chapter 7 examines immigration enforcement, with a focus on the intensification of enforcement in the United States beginning in the 1990s. This trend continues today. It has taken many forms, including stringent laws on detention and deportation of immigration law violators, substantial resources for border fortifications and enforcement in the country’s interior, and the deputization of state and local governments and the private sector. The chapter then addresses the wide gap between law on the books and law in action. Due to this gap, discretion plays a vast role in enforcement. This discretion is the foundation for the discrimination in enforcement that can evade detection and remedy. The chapter next applies this analytical framework to specific approaches to immigration enforcement, including border walls, detention, inadequate due process, criminal penalties, privatized enforcement, state and local enforcement, databases, and externalized borders. The chapter closes by addressing the limits of enforcement without more fundamental reform of the system being enforced.",

         "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               This chapter discusses the first type (or manifestation) of mafia expansion, which implies that mafia outposts attempt to govern—or control—markets and communities in the new territory. This is the most advanced form of expansion and is discussed by looking at the expansion of the Farao clan, originally based in the northeast of Calabria, into Hesse, in central Germany. Active since the 1970s, this mafia clan has set up a stable structure that is still operative at the time of writing. While the common assumption is that instances of territorial control are virtually absent outside traditional territories in Calabria, this case study reveals the opposite. From the violent takeover of drug markets in the 1990s and cases of extortion against the Calabrian community, as well as direct connections with German politicians, the chapter offers a detailed account of how, against all odds, the clan fully transplanted its core business model to the heart of Germany. The main argument is twofold. From an empirical standpoint, the same level of pervasiveness of the social, economic, and political life by the mafia that exists in Italy cannot be observed in Germany. However, from an analytical perspective, the dynamics observed in the new place of settlement mirror those that characterize regions with a traditional, long-standing mafia presence.",

Each case study analyses existing standards, both from the perspective of their alignment with the relevant legal requirements and the procedural guarantees in the applicable legal framework underlying their development and adoption imposes.",

         "In today's fast-developing business environment, how to achieve technological breakthrough and market leadership through open innovation has become a critical issue for enterprises. Open innovation, as an innovation mode, can promote enterprises to continuously conduct technological innovation through in-depth cooperation and exchange inside and outside. To implement the open innovation strategy, we first need to build an open and inclusive innovation culture and create an atmosphere conducive to innovation. At the same time, strengthen internal and external cooperation and exchanges, use external resources to make up for their own shortcomings and expand the scope of innovation. Build an open innovation platform so that enterprises can better share resources, knowledge, and achievements with the outside world. The implementation of these strategies can not only promote technological breakthroughs, but also accelerate the process of product marketization, expand market space, and enhance brand influence. Therefore, enterprises should actively embrace open innovation to achieve technological breakthroughs and market leadership, to be invincible in the fierce market competition.",

         "Solana is an emerging blockchain platform, recognized for its high throughput\nand low transaction costs, positioning it as a preferred infrastructure for\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and other Web 3.0\napplications. In the Solana ecosystem, transaction initiators submit various\ninstructions to interact with a diverse range of Solana smart contracts, among\nwhich are decentralized exchanges (DEXs) that utilize automated market makers\n(AMMs), allowing users to trade cryptocurrencies directly on the blockchain\nwithout the need for intermediaries. Despite the high throughput and low\ntransaction costs of Solana, the advantages have exposed Solana to bot spamming\nfor financial exploitation, resulting in the prevalence of failed transactions\nand network congestion.\n  Prior work on Solana has mainly focused on the evaluation of the performance\nof the Solana blockchain, particularly scalability and transaction throughput,\nas well as on the improvement of smart contract security, leaving a gap in\nunderstanding the characteristics and implications of failed transactions on\nSolana. To address this gap, we conducted a large-scale empirical study of\nfailed transactions on Solana, using a curated dataset of over 1.5 billion\nfailed transactions across more than 72 million blocks. Specifically, we first\ncharacterized the failed transactions in terms of their initiators,\nfailure-triggering programs, and temporal patterns, and compared their block\npositions and transaction costs with those of successful transactions. We then\ncategorized the failed transactions by the error messages in their error logs,\nand investigated how specific programs and transaction initiators are\nassociated with these errors...",

         "This paper presents range-based 6-DoF Monte Carlo SLAM with a gradient-guided\nparticle update strategy. While non-parametric state estimation methods, such\nas particle filters, are robust in situations with high ambiguity, they are\nknown to be unsuitable for high-dimensional problems due to the curse of\ndimensionality. To address this issue, we propose a particle update strategy\nthat improves the sampling efficiency by using the gradient information of the\nlikelihood function to guide particles toward its mode. Additionally, we\nintroduce a keyframe-based map representation that represents the global map as\na set of past frames (i.e., keyframes) to mitigate memory consumption. The\nkeyframe poses for each particle are corrected using a simple loop closure\nmethod to maintain trajectory consistency. The combination of gradient\ninformation and keyframe-based map representation significantly enhances\nsampling efficiency and reduces memory usage compared to traditional RBPF\napproaches. To process a large number of particles (e.g., 100,000 particles) in\nreal-time, the proposed framework is designed to fully exploit GPU parallel\nprocessing. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits\nextreme robustness to state ambiguity and can even deal with kidnapping\nsituations, such as when the sensor moves to different floors via an elevator,\nwith minimal heuristics.",

         "Navigating autonomous vehicles in open scenarios is a challenge due to the\ndifficulties in handling unseen objects. Existing solutions either rely on\nsmall models that struggle with generalization or large models that are\nresource-intensive. While collaboration between the two offers a promising\nsolution, the key challenge is deciding when and how to engage the large model.\nTo address this issue, this paper proposes opportunistic collaborative planning\n(OCP), which seamlessly integrates efficient local models with powerful cloud\nmodels through two key innovations. First, we propose large vision model guided\nmodel predictive control (LVM-MPC), which leverages the cloud for LVM\nperception and decision making. The cloud output serves as a global guidance\nfor a local MPC, thereby forming a closed-loop perception-to-control system.\nSecond, to determine the best timing for large model query and service, we\npropose collaboration timing optimization (CTO), including object detection\nconfidence thresholding (ODCT) and cloud forward simulation (CFS), to decide\nwhen to seek cloud assistance and when to offer cloud service. Extensive\nexperiments show that the proposed OCP outperforms existing methods in terms of\nboth navigation time and success rate.",

         "As extended reality (XR) is redefining how users interact with computing\ndevices, research in human action recognition is gaining prominence. Typically,\nmodels deployed on immersive computing devices are static and limited to their\ndefault set of classes. The goal of our research is to provide users and\ndevelopers with the capability to personalize their experience by adding new\naction classes to their device models continually. Importantly, a user should\nbe able to add new classes in a low-shot and efficient manner, while this\nprocess should not require storing or replaying any of user's sensitive\ntraining data. We formalize this problem as privacy-aware few-shot continual\naction recognition. Towards this end, we propose POET: Prompt-Offset Tuning.\nWhile existing prompt tuning approaches have shown great promise for continual\nlearning of image, text, and video modalities; they demand access to\nextensively pretrained transformers. Breaking away from this assumption, POET\ndemonstrates the efficacy of prompt tuning a significantly lightweight\nbackbone, pretrained exclusively on the base class data. We propose a novel\nspatio-temporal learnable prompt offset tuning approach, and are the first to\napply such prompt tuning to Graph Neural Networks. We contribute two new\nbenchmarks for our new problem setting in human action recognition: (i) NTU\nRGB+D dataset for activity recognition, and (ii) SHREC-2017 dataset for hand\ngesture recognition. We find that POET consistently outperforms comprehensive\nbenchmarks. Source code at\nhttps://github.com/humansensinglab/POET-continual-action-recognition.",

         "Synthetic gauge fields and non-Hermitian skin effects are pivotal to\ntopological phases and non-Hermitian physics, each recently attracting great\ninterest across diverse research fields. Notably, realizing skin effects\ntypically require nonreciprocal couplings or on-site gain and loss. Here, we\ntheoretically and experimentally report that, under gauge fields, non-Hermitian\nsystems with reciprocal couplings and without gain and loss, can nontrivially\ngive rise to an unprecedented nonreciprocal skin effect, featuring helical\nspin-dependent skin accumulations, dubbed as the ``helical spin skin effect\".\nSpecifically, we construct a lattice model with reciprocal dissipative\ncouplings and gauge fields, implemented in circuit metamaterials. Before\nintroducing the gauge fields, this model exhibits localized spin edge modes and\nextended bulk modes, without skin effects. As the gauge field strength is\napplied from $0$ to $\\pi$, we observe the emergence of two distinct spin skin\neffects and their transitions: the hybrid-order and second-order helical spin\nskin effects. Furthermore, we show that these effects can be harnessed to\nrealize helical spin-dependent nonreciprocal transmissions. Our findings not\nonly highlight gauge field induced and enriched non-Hermitian topology, but\nalso brings spin-dependent helicity into skin effects and nonreciprocality.",

Despite its advantages, EIT encounters two primary challenges:\nthe ill-posed nature of its inverse problem and the spatially variable,\nlocation-dependent sensitivity distribution. Traditional model-based methods\nmitigate ill-posedness through regularization but overlook sensitivity\nvariability, while supervised deep learning approaches require extensive\ntraining data and lack generalization. Recent developments in neural fields\nhave introduced implicit regularization techniques for image reconstruction,\nbut these methods typically neglect the physical principles underlying EIT,\nthus limiting their effectiveness. In this study, we propose PhyNC\n(Physics-driven Neural Compensation), an unsupervised deep learning framework\nthat incorporates the physical principles of EIT. PhyNC addresses both the\nill-posed inverse problem and the sensitivity distribution by dynamically\nallocating neural representational capacity to regions with lower sensitivity,\nensuring accurate and balanced conductivity reconstructions. Extensive\nevaluations on both simulated and experimental data demonstrate that PhyNC\noutperforms existing methods in terms of detail preservation and artifact\nresistance, particularly in low-sensitivity regions. Our approach enhances the\nrobustness of EIT reconstructions and provides a flexible framework that can be\nadapted to other imaging modalities with similar challenges.",

         "Accurate and reliable multi-object tracking (MOT) in 3D space is essential\nfor advancing robotics and computer vision applications. However, it remains a\nsignificant challenge in monocular setups due to the difficulty of mining 3D\nspatiotemporal associations from 2D video streams. In this work, we present\nthree innovative techniques to enhance the fusion and exploitation of\nheterogeneous cues for monocular 3D MOT: (1) we introduce the Hungarian State\nSpace Model (HSSM), a novel data association mechanism that compresses\ncontextual tracking cues across multiple paths, enabling efficient and\ncomprehensive assignment decisions with linear complexity. HSSM features a\nglobal receptive field and dynamic weights, in contrast to traditional linear\nassignment algorithms that rely on hand-crafted association costs. (2) We\npropose Fully Convolutional One-stage Embedding (FCOE), which eliminates ROI\npooling by directly using dense feature maps for contrastive learning, thus\nimproving object re-identification accuracy under challenging conditions such\nas varying viewpoints and lighting. (3) We enhance 6-DoF pose estimation\nthrough VeloSSM, an encoder-decoder architecture that models temporal\ndependencies in velocity to capture motion dynamics, overcoming the limitations\nof frame-based 3D inference. Experiments on the KITTI public test benchmark\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a new state-of-the-art\nperformance of 76.86~HOTA at 31~FPS. Our approach outperforms the previous best\nby significant margins of +2.63~HOTA and +3.62~AssA, showcasing its robustness\nand efficiency for monocular 3D MOT tasks.

         "The dynamical evolution of long-period comets (LPCs) and their meteoroid\nstreams is usually described with the Sun as the primary body, but over most of\ntheir orbits the Solar System barycenter (SSB) is effectively the orbital\nfocus. Detailed numerical integrations show that the orbital elements in the\nbarycentric reference frame are nearly constant, except within the orbit of\nJupiter where the comet or meteoroid shifts to a heliocentric orbit. Here we\nshow that this encounter can be modeled in the barycentric frame analogously to\nhow planetary close encounters are treated in the heliocentric frame, with the\ncomet captured into an elliptic orbit about the Sun as it in turn orbits SSB.\nModeling the encounters as a two-body interaction in the SSB frame gives a\ndifferent insight into the dynamics than offered by secular perturbation\nanalyses, and reveals that a large portion of the stochasticity seen in the\nevolution of the comet's orbit is due to the Sun's state relative to SSB at the\ntime of encounter. LPCs sample the Sun's state randomly at each return, so that\na statistical characterization of Sun's state is sufficient to determine the\nqualitative evolution of their orbits, including stream dispersion. The\nbarycentric orbital elements are shown to execute random walks\nwell-characterized by Maxwellian distributions. This is superimposed atop a\nsystematic orbital precession induced by planetary torques. Planetary close\nencounters add a second stochastic component, but this component does not\ntypically dominate the solar perturbations. Based on the statistics of Sun's\nstate alone, the age of a long-period comet meteoroid stream in a given orbit\ncan be derived to reasonable precision from the observed random dispersion of\nthe angular orbital elements at Earth.",

However,\nstandard RAG, relying on independent passage retrieval, fails to capture the\ninterconnected nature of human memory crucial for complex reasoning\n(associativity) and contextual understanding (sense-making). While structured\nRAG methods like HippoRAG utilize knowledge graphs (KGs) built from triples,\nthe inherent context loss limits fidelity. We introduce PropRAG, a framework\nleveraging contextually rich propositions and a novel beam search algorithm\nover proposition paths to explicitly discover multi-step reasoning chains.\nCrucially, PropRAG's online retrieval process operates entirely without\ninvoking generative LLMs, relying instead on efficient graph traversal and\npre-computed embeddings.

In this work, we\npresent a first-principles framework for computing phonon-assisted radiative\nlifetimes and exciton dynamics at finite temperatures. Starting from the\nsolution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation, we construct an effective excitonic\nHamiltonian that incorporates both exciton-photon and exciton-phonon\ninteractions. Phonon-assisted radiative lifetimes in anisotropic media are\nevaluated using time-dependent second-order perturbation theory. We further\nanalyze the temperature and phonon-mode dependence of phonon-assisted radiative\nlifetime and compare our results with available experimental data. We explain\nthe nonmonotonic temperature dependence of the phonon-assisted radiative\nlifetime by different mechanisms at low and high-temperature regimes. Finally,\nwe perform real-time exciton relaxation at the diagonal approximation of\nLindbladian dynamics for time-resolved exciton occupation, providing insights\ninto ultrafast thermalization and scattering pathways. Our ab-initio theory\noffers a detailed microscopic understanding of phonon-mediated exciton\nrelaxation and recombination processes, and provides in-depth perspectives on\nphonon-assisted many-body interactions and their influence on optical\nproperties for light-emitting and optoelectronic applications.",

         "Using the weights of trained Neural Network (NN) models as data modality has\nrecently gained traction as a research field - dubbed Weight Space Learning\n(WSL). Multiple recent works propose WSL methods to analyze models, evaluate\nmethods, or synthesize weights. Weight space learning methods require\npopulations of trained models as datasets for development and evaluation.\nHowever, existing collections of models - called `model zoos' - are\nunstructured or follow a rudimentary definition of diversity. In parallel, work\nrooted in statistical physics has identified phases and phase transitions in NN\nmodels. Models are homogeneous within the same phase but qualitatively differ\nfrom one phase to another. We combine the idea of `model zoos' with phase\ninformation to create a controlled notion of diversity in populations. We\nintroduce 12 large-scale zoos that systematically cover known phases and vary\nover model architecture, size, and datasets. These datasets cover different\nmodalities, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and\nscientific ML. For every model, we compute loss landscape metrics and validate\nfull coverage of the phases. With this dataset, we provide the community with a\nresource with a wide range of potential applications for WSL and beyond.\nEvidence suggests the loss landscape phase plays a role in applications such as\nmodel training, analysis, or sparsification. We demonstrate this in an\nexploratory study of the downstream methods like transfer learning or model\nweights averaging.",

Such approaches\nmust integrate a series of biophysical models encompassing the nervous system,\nmuscles, biomechanics to allow observing the system in its entirety while\nsupporting model variations. Here we develop modWorm: a modular modeling\nframework for the nematode C. elegans. modWorm allows for construction of a\nmodel as an integrated series of configurable, exchangeable modules each\ndescribing specific biophysical processes across different modalities.\nUtilizing modWorm, we propose a base neuro-mechanical model for C. elegans\nbuilt upon the complete connectome. The model integrates a series of 7 modules:\ni) intra-cellular dynamics, ii) electrical and iii) chemical extra-cellular\nneural dynamics, iv) translation of neural activity to muscle calcium dynamics,\nv) muscle calcium dynamics to muscle forces, vi) muscle forces to body postures\nand vii) proprioceptive feedback. We validate the base model by in-silico\ninjection of constant currents into neurons known to be associated with\nlocomotion behaviors and by applying external forces to the body. Applications\nof in-silico neural stimuli experimentally known to modulate locomotion show\nthat the model can recapitulate natural behavioral responses such as forward\nand backward locomotion as well as mid-locomotion responses such as avoidance\nand turns. Furthermore, through in-silico ablation surveys, the model can infer\nnovel neural circuits involved in sensorimotor behaviors. To further dissect\nmechanisms of locomotion, we utilize modWorm to introduce empirical based model\nvariations and model optimizations to elucidate their effects on simulated\nlocomotion. Our results show that modWorm can be utilized to identify neural\ncircuits which control, mediate and generate natural behavior.",

         "Quartz is extensively used for luminescence and ESR dosimetry as well as\ndating. These techniques use inherent defects introduced in quartz crystal\nduring its crystallization in nature. The defect comprises both intrinsic as\nwell as extrinsic defects. These defects give important luminescence properties\nto quartz but are not yet well understood from a theoretical perspective.\nSpecifically, in case of luminescence dosimetry the nature of traps and their\ninvolvement in luminescence production is not exactly known. Thus, present work\nattempts to understand the basic physics of defects and their implication for\nluminescence and ESR techniques via Density Functional Theory (DFT) modelling.\nThe work uses DFT to model the presence of some possible major impurities in\nquartz. Several interesting novel results are obtained that will have\nimplications for ongoing research in Luminescence and ESR methods. The DFT\nmodelling suggested that Oxygen deficiency in quartz crystal results in the\nformation of both electron and hole trapping centres. However, it is observed\nthat these centres can be passivated by the introduction of charge compensating\nOH or H ions. Further, it is found that peroxy defects can be formed in the\npresence of either excess Oxygen or due to the absence of Silicon (Si4+),\nhowever, the nature of the traps formed in both cases is different. Besides\nthese intrinsic defects, Al and Fe are the major impurities which are observed\nas defects in quartz. The modelling of these impurities suggested that\nnegligible change in DOS is observed for Al defect and Fe generally forms a\nrecombination centre or hole trap. In addition to these, there are several\ninteresting first-time observations that are not reported and will be helpful\nfor progressing luminescence and ESR dosimetry research.",

Therefore, estimating this generation\nfrom net load, known as PV disaggregation, is critical. Given privacy concerns\nand the need for large training datasets, federated learning becomes a\npromising approach, but statistical heterogeneity, arising from geographical\nand behavioral variations among prosumers, poses new challenges to PV\ndisaggregation. To overcome these challenges, a privacy-preserving distributed\nPV disaggregation framework is proposed using Personalized Federated Learning\n(PFL). The proposed method employs a two-level framework that combines local\nand global modeling. At the local level, a transformer-based PV disaggregation\nmodel is designed to generate solar irradiance embeddings for representing\nlocal PV conditions. A novel adaptive local aggregation mechanism is adopted to\nmitigate the impact of statistical heterogeneity on the local model, extracting\na portion of global information that benefits the local model. At the global\nlevel, a central server aggregates information uploaded from multiple data\ncenters, preserving privacy while enabling cross-center knowledge sharing.\nExperiments on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of this proposed\nframework, showing improved accuracy and robustness compared to benchmark\nmethods.",

However, self-converse graphs are\nextremely rare; this paper considers a more general class of oriented graphs\n$\\mathcal{G}_{n}$ (not limited to self-converse graphs), consisting of all\n$n$-vertex oriented graphs $\\Sigma$ such that $2^{-\\left \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2}\n\\right \\rfloor }\\det W(\\Sigma)$ is an odd and square-free integer, where\n$W(\\Sigma)=[e,Se,\\dots,S^{n-1}e]$ ($e$ is the all-one vector) is the skew-walk\nmatrix of $\\Sigma$. Given that $\\Sigma$ is cospectral with its converse\n$\\Sigma^{\\rm T}$, there always exists a unique regular rational orthogonal\n$Q_0$ such that $Q_0^{\\rm T}SQ_0=-S$. This study reveals that there exists a\ndeep relationship between the level $\\ell_0$ of $Q_0$ and the number of\ngeneralized cospectral mates of $\\Sigma$. More precisely, we show, among\nothers, that the maximum number of generalized cospectral mates of\n$\\Sigma\\in\\mathcal{G}_{n}$ is at most $2^{t}-1$, where $t$ is the number of\nprime factors of $\\ell_0$. Moreover, some numerical examples are also provided\nto demonstrate that the above upper bound is attainable. Finally, we also\nprovide a criterion for the oriented graphs $\\Sigma\\in\\mathcal{G}_{n}$ to be\nweakly determined by the generalized skew-spectrum ($\\mathrm{WDGSS})$.",

         "Efficient GNN Training Through Structure-Aware Randomized Mini-Batching",
         "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) enable learning on realworld graphs and\nmini-batch training has emerged as the de facto standard for training GNNs\nbecause it can scale to very large graphs and improve convergence. Current\nmini-batch construction policies largely ignore efficiency considerations of\nGNN training. Specifically, existing mini-batching techniques employ\nrandomization schemes to improve accuracy and convergence. However, these\nrandomization schemes are often agnostic to the structural properties of the\ngraph (for eg. community structure), resulting in highly irregular memory\naccess patterns during GNN training that make suboptimal use of on-chip GPU\ncaches. On the other hand, while deterministic mini-batching based solely on\ngraph structure delivers fast runtime performance, the lack of randomness\ncompromises both the final model accuracy and training convergence speed. In\nthis paper, we present Community-structure-aware Randomized Mini-batching\n(COMM-RAND), a novel methodology that bridges the gap between the above\nextremes. COMM-RAND allows practitioners to explore the space between pure\nrandomness and pure graph structural awareness during mini-batch construction,\nleading to significantly more efficient GNN training with similar accuracy. We\nevaluated COMM-RAND across four popular graph learning benchmarks. COMM-RAND\ncuts down GNN training time by up to 2.76x (1.8x on average) while achieving an\naccuracy that is within 1.79% points (0.42% on average) compared to popular\nrandom mini-batching approaches.",

         "As modern vehicles evolve into intelligent and connected systems, their\ngrowing complexity introduces significant cybersecurity risks. Threat Analysis\nand Risk Assessment (TARA) has therefore become essential for managing these\nrisks under mandatory regulations. However, existing TARA automation methods\nrely on static threat libraries, limiting their utility in the detailed,\nfunction-level analyses demanded by industry. This paper introduces\nDefenseWeaver, the first system that automates function-level TARA using\ncomponent-specific details and large language models (LLMs). DefenseWeaver\ndynamically generates attack trees and risk evaluations from system\nconfigurations described in an extended OpenXSAM++ format, then employs a\nmulti-agent framework to coordinate specialized LLM roles for more robust\nanalysis. To further adapt to evolving threats and diverse standards,\nDefenseWeaver incorporates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning and\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with expert-curated TARA reports. We\nvalidated DefenseWeaver through deployment in four automotive security\nprojects, where it identified 11 critical attack paths, verified through\npenetration testing, and subsequently reported and remediated by the relevant\nautomakers and suppliers. Additionally, DefenseWeaver demonstrated cross-domain\nadaptability, successfully applying to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and\nmarine navigation systems. In comparison to human experts, DefenseWeaver\noutperformed manual attack tree generation across six assessment scenarios.\nIntegrated into commercial cybersecurity platforms such as UAES and Xiaomi,\nDefenseWeaver has generated over 8,200 attack trees. These results highlight\nits ability to significantly reduce processing time, and its scalability and\ntransformative impact on cybersecurity across industries.",

The\nproposed approach is evaluated on CoQA and OBQA datasets using Llama2-7b,\nMistral-7b and Phi-2 models and is shown to outperform the standard model in\nboth datasets in terms of correctness of answer while also showing potential in\nestimating the second level uncertainty in its predictions and providing the\ncapability to detect when its hallucinating.",

         "In this article we consider three inert models, namely the inert singlet\nmodel (ISM), inert triplet model (ITM), and inert doublet model (IDM) as beyond\nStandard Model scenarios, and look into the running of the scalar quartic\ncouplings at one- and two-loop levels. Interestingly, the Landau poles at\none-loop and Fixed points at two-loop have been observed for these scenarios,\nvery similar to the $\\phi^4$ theory, which is absent in the Standard Model. The\nrole of Higgs portal couplings in attaining these features has been examined.\nFor inert singlet and triplet models, the portal couplings give rise to terms\nwithout any residual phases, enhancing this Fixed point behaviour. In the case\nof the inert doublet model, $\\lambda_{4,5}$ terms which have the residual\nphases, spoil this behaviour. Finally, we consider perturbative unitarity\nconstraints to put limits on the scalar quartic couplings for various\nperturbativity scales in both one- and two-loop. Larger portal couplings, i.e.\n$\\gsim 2$, get strong perturbative bounds as low as $10^{2-3}$ GeV.",

         "Recent advances in Talking Head Generation (THG) have achieved impressive lip\nsynchronization and visual quality through diffusion models; yet existing\nmethods struggle to generate emotionally expressive portraits while preserving\nspeaker identity. We identify three critical limitations in current emotional\ntalking head generation: insufficient utilization of audio's inherent emotional\ncues, identity leakage in emotion representations, and isolated learning of\nemotion correlations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework\ndubbed as DICE-Talk, following the idea of disentangling identity with emotion,\nand then cooperating emotions with similar characteristics. First, we develop a\ndisentangled emotion embedder that jointly models audio-visual emotional cues\nthrough cross-modal attention, representing emotions as identity-agnostic\nGaussian distributions. Second, we introduce a correlation-enhanced emotion\nconditioning module with learnable Emotion Banks that explicitly capture\ninter-emotion relationships through vector quantization and attention-based\nfeature aggregation. Third, we design an emotion discrimination objective that\nenforces affective consistency during the diffusion process through\nlatent-space classification. Extensive experiments on MEAD and HDTF datasets\ndemonstrate our method's superiority, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches\nin emotion accuracy while maintaining competitive lip-sync performance.\nQualitative results and user studies further confirm our method's ability to\ngenerate identity-preserving portraits with rich, correlated emotional\nexpressions that naturally adapt to unseen identities.",

         "Quantum machine learning is an approach that aims to improve the performance\nof machine learning methods by leveraging the properties of quantum computers.\nIn quantum circuit learning (QCL), a supervised learning method that can be\nimplemented using variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), the process of\nencoding input data into quantum states has been widely discussed for its\nimportant role on the expressive power of learning models. In particular, the\nproperties of the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian used for encoding\nsignificantly influence model performance. Recent encoding methods have\ndemonstrated that the expressive power of learning models can be enhanced by\napplying exponentially large magnetic fields proportional to the number of\nqubits. However, this approach poses a challenge as it requires exponentially\nincreasing magnetic fields, which are impractical for implementation in\nlarge-scale systems. Here, we propose a QCL method that leverages a\nnon-integrable Hamiltonian for encoding, aiming to achieve both enhanced\nexpressive power and practical feasibility. We find that the thermalization\nproperties of non-integrable systems over long timescales, implying that the\nenergy difference has a low probability to be degenerate, lead to an enhanced\nexpressive power for QCL. Since the required magnetic field strength remains\nwithin a practical range, our approach to using the non-integrable system is\nsuitable for large-scale quantum computers. Our results bridge the dynamics of\nnon-integrable systems and the field of quantum machine learning, suggesting\nthe potential for significant interdisciplinary contributions.",

         "Physics-informed neural networks have attracted significant attention in\nscientific machine learning for their capability to solve forward and inverse\nproblems governed by partial differential equations. However, the accuracy of\nPINN solutions is often limited by the treatment of boundary conditions.\nConventional penalty-based methods, which incorporate boundary conditions as\npenalty terms in the loss function, cannot guarantee exact satisfaction of the\ngiven boundary conditions and are highly sensitive to the choice of penalty\nparameters. This paper demonstrates that distance functions, specifically\nR-functions, can be leveraged to enforce boundary conditions, overcoming these\nlimitations. R-functions provide normalized distance fields, enabling accurate\nrepresentation of boundary geometries, including non-convex domains, and\nfacilitating various types of boundary conditions. We extend this distance\nfunction-based boundary condition imposition method to inverse problems using\nPINNs and introduce an adaptive weight tuning technique to ensure reliable and\nefficient inverse analysis. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method through\nseveral numerical experiments. Numerical results show that the proposed method\nsolves inverse problems more accurately and efficiently than penalty-based\nmethods, even in the presence of complex non-convex geometries.

Recently, it has been\nreported that an intermetallic HoAgGe exhibits two distinct magnetic structures\nwith the finite magnetic vector $q=(1/3,1/3,0)$: One is the partially ordered\nstate in the intermediate-temperature region, and the other is the kagome spin\nice state in the lowest-temperature region. We theoretically elucidate that the\nformer is characterized by antiferro magnetic toroidal (MT) ordering, while the\nlatter is characterized by ferri MT ordering based on the multipole\nrepresentation theory, which provides an opposite interpretation to previous\nstudies. We also show how antiferro MT and ferri MT orderings are\nmicroscopically formed by quantifying the magnetic toroidal moment activated in\na multiorbital system. As a result, we find that the degree of distortion for\nthe kagome structure plays a significant role in determining the nature of\nantiferro MT and ferri MT orderings, which brings about the crossover between\nthe antiferro MT and ferri MT orders.

         "Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has become a crucial technology\nin the development of next-generation wireless communication systems. The\nintegration of communication and sensing functionalities on a unified spectrum\nand infrastructure is expected to enable a variety of emerging use cases. The\nintroduction of ISAC has led to various new challenges and opportunities\nrelated to the security of wireless communications, resulting in significant\nresearch focused on ISAC system design in relation to physical layer security\n(PLS). The shared use of spectrum presents a risk where confidential messages\nembedded in probing ISAC signals may be exposed to potentially malicious\nsensing targets. This situation creates a tradeoff between sensing performance\nand security performance. The sensing functionality of ISAC offers a unique\nopportunity for PLS by utilizing sensing information regarding potential\neavesdroppers to design secure PLS schemes. This study examines PLS\nmethodologies to tackle the specified security challenge associated with ISAC.\nThe study begins with a brief overview of performance metrics related to PLS\nand sensing, as well as the optimization techniques commonly utilized in the\nexisting literature. A thorough examination of existing literature on PLS for\nISAC is subsequently presented, with the objective of emphasizing the current\nstate of research. The study concludes by outlining potential avenues for\nfuture research pertaining to secure ISAC systems.",

         "Nonstabilizerness or `magic' is a crucial resource for quantum computers\nwhich can be distilled from noisy quantum states. However, determining the\nmagic of mixed quantum has been a notoriously difficult task. Here, we provide\nefficient witnesses of magic based on the stabilizer R\\'enyi entropy which\nrobustly indicate the presence of magic and quantitatively estimate magic\nmonotones. We also design efficient property testing algorithms to reliably\ndistinguish states with high and low magic, assuming the entropy is bounded. We\napply our methods to certify the number of noisy T-gates under a wide class of\nnoise models. Additionally, using the IonQ quantum computer, we experimentally\nverify the magic of noisy random quantum circuits. Surprisingly, we find that\nmagic is highly robust, persisting even under exponentially strong noise. Our\nwitnesses can also be efficiently computed for matrix product states, revealing\nthat subsystems of many-body quantum states can contain extensive magic despite\nentanglement. Finally, our work also has direct implications for cryptography\nand pseudomagic: To mimic high magic states with as little magic as possible,\none requires an extensive amount of entropy. This implies that entropy is a\nnecessary resource to hide magic from eavesdroppers. Our work uncovers powerful\ntools to verify and study the complexity of noisy quantum systems.",

Among them tongue being a highly\nversatile active articulator responsible for shaping airflow to produce\ntargeted speech sounds that are intellectual, clear, and distinct. This paper\npresents a novel approach for predicting tongue and lip articulatory features\ninvolved in a given speech acoustics using a stacked Bidirectional Long\nShort-Term Memory (BiLSTM) architecture, combined with a one-dimensional\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) for post-processing with fixed weights\ninitialization. The proposed network is trained with two datasets consisting of\nsimultaneously recorded speech and Electromagnetic Articulography (EMA)\ndatasets, each introducing variations in terms of geographical origin,\nlinguistic characteristics, phonetic diversity, and recording equipment. The\nperformance of the model is assessed in Speaker Dependent (SD), Speaker\nIndependent (SI), corpus dependent (CD) and cross corpus (CC) modes.\nExperimental results indicate that the proposed model with fixed weights\napproach outperformed the adaptive weights initialization with in relatively\nminimal number of training epochs. These findings contribute to the development\nof robust and efficient models for articulatory feature prediction, paving the\nway for advancements in speech production research and applications.",

         "In the analysis of square contingency tables with ordered categories, it is\nessential to assess deviations from marginal homogeneity (MH) when marginal\nequivalency between row and column variables does not hold. Some measures for\nevaluating the degree of departure from the MH model have been proposed. This\nstudy proposes a new directional measure using the discrete-time hazard,\nassuming that categories represent discrete time points. The proposed measure\nis capable of capturing both the magnitude and direction of deviation from the\nMH model. It is defined on a continuous scale from $-1$ to $1$, which allows\nfor intuitive interpretation of the nature of marginal change.\n  An estimator of the proposed measure and an asymptotic confidence interval\nare derived using the delta method. The theoretical properties of the measure\nare also discussed. The proposed measure provides a flexible tool for\ncharacterizing marginal inhomogeneity in square contingency tables under\nordinal settings.",

         "T-wave alternans (TWA) is a potential marker for sudden cardiac death, but\nits reliable analysis is often constrained to noise-free environments, limiting\nits utility in real-world settings. We explore model-based T-wave estimation to\nmitigate the impact of noise on TWA level. Detection was performed using a\nprevious surrogate-based method as a benchmark and a new method based on a\nMarkov model state transition matrix (STM). These were combined with a Modified\nMoving Average (MMA) method and polynomial T-wave modeling to enhance noise\nrobustness. Methods were tested across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios\n(SNRs), from -5 to 30 dB, and different noise types: baseline wander (BW),\nmuscle artifacts (MA), electrode movement (EM), and respiratory modulation.\nSynthetic ECGs with known TWA levels were used: 0 uV for TWA-free and 30-72 uV\nfor TWA-present signals. T-wave modeling improved estimation accuracy under\nnoisy conditions. With EM noise at SNRs of -5 and 5 dB, mean absolute error\n(MAE) dropped from 62 to 49 uV and 27 to 25 uV, respectively (Mann-Whitney-U\ntest, p < 0.05) with modeling applied. Similar improvements were seen with MA\nnoise: MAE dropped from 100 to 70 uV and 26 to 23 uV. In detection, the STM\nmethod achieved an F1-score of 0.92, outperforming the surrogate-based method\n(F1 = 0.81), though both struggled under EM noise at -5 dB. Importantly, beyond\nSNR, detection performance depended on the number of beats analyzed. These\nfindings show that combining model-based estimation with STM detection\nsignificantly improves TWA analysis under noise, supporting its application in\nambulatory and wearable ECG monitoring.",

         "Quantum resources enable secure quantum sensing (SQS) of remote systems,\noffering significant advantages in precision and security. However, decoherence\nin the quantum communication channel and during the evolution of quantum states\ncan erode these advantages. In this work, we first propose a general\n$N-$particle scheme that achieves Heisenberg-limited (HL) scaling for\nsingle-parameter estimation in the presence of an ideal quantum communication\nchannel and encoding scenario. For non-ideal dynamics, we introduce a modified\nprotocol incorporating local quantum optimal control (QOC) operations to\naddress noise in SQS under generalized Pauli dephasing and parallel dephasing\nnoise. We analyze two distinct scenarios: a noiseless communication channel\nwith noisy evolution, and a noisy communication channel with noisy evolution.\nFor the noisy channel, we model the link between the communicating parties as a\ndepolarizing channel. The protocol leverages QOC operations to actively\nmitigate noise, enhancing the achievable quantum Fisher information (QFI) and\nthe classical Fisher information (CFI) based on the chosen measurement\nstrategy.",
